	<name>DIRAC Manager</name>
	<tagline>Workload management service to distribute and manage centrally thousands of computational tasks both on cloud and HTC</tagline>
	<description>The DIRAC service is a workload management service used to distribute the users' computing tasks among the available resources both HTC and cloud. The service supports established Virtual Organization as well as the long tail of users. Main features: Provides a High Throughput Computing PaaS, which improves the general job throughput compared with native management of grid storage. This is possible at DIRAC configuration level, connecting compute and storage resources for particular use requirements. DIRAC File Catalogue includes replica, metadata and provenance functionality simplifying the development of scientific application adaptions for distributed environments. DIRAC data and job management systems ensure proven production scalability up to peaks of 80 thousand concurrently running jobs for the LHCb experiment. This is by far large enough for the computing requirements of environmental science in a sensible temporal horizon.</description>
