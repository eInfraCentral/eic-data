    <description>"EGI Accounting stores user accounting records from various services offered by EGI, such as Cloud, HTC
        and
        storage usage. It works thanks to a network of message brokers that transfer usage data from the host to a
        central
        repository of information. The data is handled securely and can be consulted online through the EGI Accounting
        Portal.
        EGI council members can use EGI accounting services to account for the resource usage of their own services.
        EGI Accounting gives:
        - Increased control over resource consumption
        - Reduced overhead of defining data models, architecture and setup of an accounting system
        - Reduced cost of maintaining an accounting infrastructure
        - Access to a reliable, high available, high performance service
        - User friendly web interface"
