"$"This service manages the APC fund - reimbursing APC and BPC up to a limited amount, running a pilot for the EC. Applications for the fund can be done on individual basis, project basis or it can be done via an intermediary (institution or publisher). The pilot agreed on block grants and prepayment agreements with instiutions and publishers. The Pilot also encompassed an Alternative Funding Mechanism workline. The service can be configured and delpoyed locally at any research library to manage APCs from different funders."$"The service tracks, collects and analyzes usage data from the network of OpenAIRE data providers and exploits usage metrics like downloads and metadata views. Tracking of usage activity is performed by exploiting the Open Source Piwik analytics platform. In addition, usage statistics reports can be collected from SUSHI-Lite compatible endpoints. The analysis uses the COUNTER rules and the latest robots.txt files as provided by the library and the IT communities. Taking advantage of OpenAIRE's Graph service de-duplication mechanism, it aggregates/merges usage stats that come from different sources and relate to the same object. Note: The service (currently in beta) will be initially deployed for the OpenAIRE network use, but we envision to provide this in different installations/settings."$"The Broker service supports: the exchange of metadata and content amongst repositories, publishers or aggregators, and the enrichement of repository local metadata.

Preparatory Access is strongly recommended to collect technical data to support the request of resources. Proposals for Project Access must be based on computer codes and data ready to run on the Tier-0 systems. "$"The objective of PRACE Preparatory Access is to allow PRACE users to optimise, scale and test codes on PRACE Tier-0 systems before applying to PRACE calls for Project Access. Production runs are not allowed as part of PRACE Preparatory Access. Currently, PRACE offers the following schemes for Preparatory Access:Type A: this scheme is intended to produce scalability plots of the performance of the codes on PRACE HPC systems, as well as other parameters that may be relevant to apply for PRACE calls for Project Access. The maximum duration of Type A projects is 2 months. Type B: the objective of this scheme is to undertake code development and optimisation. Applicants will need to describe the proposed work plan in detail, including the human resources and expertise available to implement the project. The maximum duration of Type B projects is 6 months. Type C: in this scheme, PRACE experts are requested to provide the necessary support to undertake adaptations (development and optimisation) to the codes of PRACE users. The maximum support that can be requested is the equivalent to 6 person-months of effort. The maximum duration of Type C projects is 6 months. Type D: this scheme allows PRACE users to start a code adaption and optimisation process on a PRACE Tier-1 system. PRACE experts help in the system selection process. In addition to Tier-1 computing time, the PRACE user will also receive Tier-0 computing time towards the end of the project (in form of the Type A scheme) to test the scalability improvements. The work is supported by PRACE experts. The maximum support that can be requested is the equivalent to 6 person-months of effort. The maximum duration of Type D projects is 12 months."$"Proposals must deal with complex, demanding, innovative simulations that would not be possible without Tier-1 access. Proposals from academia and industry are eligible, as long as the project leader is undertaking non-proprietary research in a European country (European Union, candidates, associated countries and PRACE member countries). Project leaders will typically be employed in research organisations (academic or industrial). Individual HPC centres may have further restrictions on who is eligible to use the machines, e.g. due to US export rules."$"Enable applications for project access, users in porting, scaling and optimising their applications to fully exploit the capabilities of PRACE systems."$"SHAPE, the SME HPC Adoption Programme in Europe is a pan-European, PRACE-based programme supporting HPC adoption by SMEs.
