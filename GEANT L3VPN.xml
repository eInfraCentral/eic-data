    <description>"L3-VPNs are ideal for many-to-many (peer-to-peer) or one-to-many (central-site-to-satellite)
        environments, where each site can be allocated bandwidth according to its own requirements. Each site can
        support bandwidths from 155Mbps to 100Gbps (subject to availability).​ This service allocates unique VLAN
        (virtual local area network) identifiers to each L3-VPN to ensure data isolation across the GÉANT network,
        giving assured performance and secur​​ity. The GÉANT L3-VPN service provides NRENs with the backbone
        infrastructure to enable custom VPN services for their users across the GÉANT backbone."
