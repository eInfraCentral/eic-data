	<tagline>Access key scientific datasets scalably</tagline>
	<description>Access selected public datasets and efficiently consume them from EGI compute services. Main features: Discovery of data via a central portal. This will include a searching mechanism plus a rating system which may be based on, e.g. number of accesses. Access to data conforming to required policies which may be: unauthenticated open access; access after user registration or access restricted to members of a Virtual Organization (VO). This access may be via a GUI (e.g. a webpage) or an API (e.g. programmatic access to the data). Replication of data from data providers for resiliency and availability purposes. Replication may take place either on demand or automatically. Replication will require the introduction of a file catalogue to enable tracking of logical and physical copies of data. Access to data from the AppDB to enable VOs to associate appropriate data with matching Virtual Appliances. Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (AAI) integration between the DataHub and with other EGI components and with user communities existing infrastructure. File catalogue to track replication of data: logical and physical file.</description>
