    <description>The PRACE CodeVault is an open repository containing various high performance computing code samples
        for the HPC community. The CodeVault is an open platform that supports self-education of learning HPC
        programming skills where HPC users can share example code snippets, proof-of-concept codes and more. The PRACE
        CodeVault contains training material from PRACE partners, as well as example codes for common HPC kernels, such
        as dense and sparse linear algebra, spectral and N-body methods, structured and unstructured grids, Monte Carlo
        methods and parallel I/O. The code samples are published as open source and can be used both for educational
        purposes and as parts of real application suites (as permitted by particular licenses).
