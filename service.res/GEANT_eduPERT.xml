    <fullName>-</fullName>
    <description>Performance Enhancement Response Teams (PERTs) provide an investigation and consulting service to
        academic and research users on their network performance issues. As networks and networked applications develop,
        increasing demands are made on performance and reliability, with a need for skilled experts to be able to
        respond rapidly to issues to help solve users’ problems quickly and efficiently.​ It is essential that teams
        have access to the latest information, tools and experience from other experts, ensuring they pool their
        knowledge in the face of the ever-changing technologies involved.
