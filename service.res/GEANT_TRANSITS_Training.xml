    <description>TRANSITS provides affordable, high-quality training to both new and experienced computer security
        incident response team (CSIRT) personnel, as well as individuals with a bona-fide interest in establishing a
        CSIRT. There are two types of training course: TRANSITS-I for new recruits, and TRANSITS-II for more experienced
        personnel. GÉANT runs regular training courses within Europe on a cost recovery basis, with financial support
        from ENISA, the European Union agency for network and information security. The TRANSITS-I course materials may
        also be licensed to those wishing to organise their own courses.
