    <description>EGI Accounting stores user accounting records from various services offered by EGI, such as Cloud, HTC
        and storage usage. It works thanks to a network of message brokers that transfer usage data from the host to a
        central repository of information. The data is handled securely and can be consulted online through the EGI
        Accounting Portal. EGI council members can use EGI accounting services to account for the resource usage of
        their own services. EGI Accounting gives: - Increased control over resource consumption - Reduced overhead of
        defining data models, architecture and setup of an accounting system - Reduced cost of maintaining an accounting
        infrastructure - Access to a reliable, high available, high performance service - User friendly web interface
