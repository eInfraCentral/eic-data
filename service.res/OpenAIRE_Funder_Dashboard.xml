    <description>The Funder Dashboard is built on the OpenAIRE Graph and provides a monitoring and reporting mechanism
        (including vizualization) that allows funders and policy makers to monitor all their funded research outcomes.
        Additional functionalities include private pages that allow configuration and deployment of on-demand
        visualization services. Note: The Funder Dashboard will be an extension of the current OpenAIRE monitoring
        pages, by integrating more elaborate queires and advanced visualizations.
