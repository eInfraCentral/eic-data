    <fullName>PRACE Distributed European Computing Initiative (Tier-1) Access</fullName>
    <description>Proposals must deal with complex, demanding, innovative simulations that would not be possible without
        Tier-1 access. Proposals from academia and industry are eligible, as long as the project leader is undertaking
        non-proprietary research in a European place (European Union, candidates, associated countries and PRACE
        member countries). Project leaders will typically be employed in research organisations (academic or
        industrial). Individual HPC centres may have further restrictions on who is eligible to use the machines, e.g.
        due to US export rules.
