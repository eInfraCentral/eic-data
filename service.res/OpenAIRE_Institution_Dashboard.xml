    <tagline>One-stop-shop for institutional open research monitoring</tagline>
    <fullName>OpenAIRE Institution Dashboard</fullName>
    <description>The Institution Dashboard is built on the OpenAIRE Graph and provides a monitoring and reporting
        mechanism (including vizualization) that allows research administrators to monitor all institution research
        outcomes. Additional functionalities include private portals that allow configuration and deployment of
        on-demand services to search, browse, and navigate the research institution outputs, as well as to
        authoritatively link and validate them. Note: The Institution Dashboard will be an extension of the current
        OpenAIRE organization landing pages which already provides monitoring and reporting, by integrating existing
        TRL9 services.
