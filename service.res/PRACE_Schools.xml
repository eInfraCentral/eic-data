    <description>The PRACE Seasonal Schools have been running since 2008 as part of the PRACE educational programme
        offering top-quality face-to-face training events organized around Europe, aiming to improve the skills
        necessary for the use of the PRACE ecosystem. The seasonal school topics range from generic intermediate to
        advanced programming techniques to more specialized topical schools that e.g. focus on a specific topic, such as
        big data, or offer discipline specific parallel tracks.
