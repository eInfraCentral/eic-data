    <description>The OpenAIRE Discovery portal provides access to Open Access research content. It is based on
        OpenAIRE's open scholarly communication graph that includes all research and scholarly activitiies, spanning all
        phases of the research life cycle. The OpenAIRE scholarly communication graph is created bi-monthly by
        aggregating, cleaning, transforming and inferring content retrieved from OpenAIRE's European and global network
        of validated OA data providers. In addition to the usual search and browse mechanisms, the OpenAIRE Discovery
        portal provides end user functionalities which allow users to: - find the most fitting repository to deposit
        their publication or data, - authoritavely enrich the underlying content (e.g., linking research results to
        funding, linking research resultsto external sources), - view, download reports or graphs of aggregated research
        outcomes (e.g., per funder, project, institution) and their stats.
