	<tagline>"Building mutual trust between security teams​​​."</tagline>
	<description>"Many research and education networking organisations, commercial internet service providers, telecommunications operators and governments have established computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) to deal with network security incidents. Collaboration between trusted teams is very important because incidents often originate from outside the network that is affected. The Trusted Introducer (TI) service forms the backbone of infrastructure services and acts as a clearinghouse for all computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), building a ‘web of trust’ between CSIRTs by listing known teams, and accrediting and certifying teams according to their demonstrated and checked level of maturity."</description>
