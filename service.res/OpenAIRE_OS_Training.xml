    <description>This service offers EC OA policy training and support providing the body of resources to facilitate the
        easy uptake and comprehension of the OA mandate to publications and data, as well as a broader open science
        agenda among a wide range of stakeholders. For example it helps project coordinators to comply with OA funder's
        requirements; assists repository managers and journal editors and publishers with making their repositories and
        journals compatible with the OpenAIRE Guidelines; works with national research funders to align their policies
        with EC OA policies; organizes conferences, workshops and other knowledge sharing and community-building events
        and activities to promote availability of OA publications and research data and open science.
