	<description>perfSONAR can be used by GÉANT, national research and education networking (NREN) organisations, campuses and major projects for quick and easy performance troubleshooting. It provides easy, transparent end-to-end monitoring, giving access to network measurement data from multiple network domains. It can operate at local level or around the globe and is scalable to provide at-a-glance information about multiple network paths simultaneously. By tracking performance across and between domains it is now possible to identify and rectify any potential performance bottlenecks, helping research teams focus their efforts on their research and allowing NRENs to identify where investments in new capacity will provide the best return. With more than 1,400 measurement points​ across the globe, it is now far easier for NRENs and research teams to accurately measure network performance and ensure it meets their research needs.​ The development of perfSONAR is the result of the combined work of GÉANT, Internet2, ESnet and Indiana University.</description>
