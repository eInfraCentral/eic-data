    <fullName>SME HPC Adoption Programme in Europe</fullName>
    <description>SHAPE, the SME HPC Adoption Programme in Europe is a pan-European, PRACE-based programme supporting HPC
        adoption by SMEs. The Programme aims to raise awareness and equip European SMEs with the expertise necessary to
        take advantage of the innovation possibilities opened up by High Performance Computing (HPC), thus increasing
        their competitiveness. HPC is a powerful technology that can enable the development of new products or services,
        reduce time-to-market and cost of R&amp;D or increase quality. The opportunities opened up by HPC are vast and
        an increasing number of SMEs turn to HPC in order to create new business opportunities.
