    <description>This service identifies and annotates large archives of publications with thematic information, i.e.,
        topics, and then leverage them as a means to link documents with other related information, e.g., authors,
        grants, and journals. Hence, the service analyzes textual information (e.g., abstracts, content), relational
        information (e.g., publication citations, authorship network), and varied additional side information (e.g.,
        authors, venues, grants) possibly including taxonomies (e.g., ACM CCS, MeSH) and identifies overlapping entity
        clusters and related entity-to-cluster memberships, and characterize the clusters with multi-view thematic
        information (i.e., topics) combining all disparate information sources.
