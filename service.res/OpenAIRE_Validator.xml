    <fullName>OpenAIRE Validation Service</fullName>
    <description>This service performs validation checks on both the quality of implementation of the OAI-PMH protocol
        and the conformance of the metadata to the specific schemas. It is a rule based system which also provides an
        admin panel that allows its users to easily configure the individual validation rules and sets of rules, that
        implement the guidelines. OpenAIRE uses it to validate all its registered data providers (literature
        repositories, OA publishers, data repositories/archives, aggregators, CRIS systems) to the OpenAIRE guidelines.
