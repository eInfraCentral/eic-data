    <description>The GÉANT Multi-Domain Virtual Private Network (MD-VPN) provides an end-to-end international network
        service that enables scientists all over Europe to collaborate via a common private network infrastructure. The
        MD-VPN​ service can be used for connectivity between clusters, grids, clouds and HPC (high-performance
        computing) centres, allowing them to form v​​​​irtual distributed resources for third-party research projects.
        MD-VPN offers fast delivery of VPNs to end users and so can be used in a variety of ways, from a long-term
        infrastructure with a high demand for intensive network usage to quick point-to-point connections for a
        con​ference demonstration.​

    <userValue>VPNs are ideal for many-to-many (pee​r-to-peer) or one-to-many (central-site-to-satellite) environments,
        where each site can be allocated bandwidth according to its own requirements. Each site can support bandwidths
        from 155Mbps to 100Gbps (subject to availability).
