B2SAFE is a robust, safe and highly available service which allows community and departmental repositories to implement data management policies on their research data across multiple administrative domains in a trustworthy manner. It offers: abstraction layer of large scale, heterogeneous data storages, guards against data loss in long-term archiving, allows to optimize access for users (e.g. from different regions), brings data closer to facilities for compute-intensive analysis.$B2SHARE is a user-friendly, reliable and trustworthy way for researchers, scientific communities and citizen scientists to store and share small-scale research data from diverse contexts. B2SHARE is a solution that facilitates research data storage, guarantees long-term persistence of data and allows data, results or ideas to be shared worldwide.$B2DROP is a secure and trusted data exchange service for researchers and scientists to keep their research data synchronized and up-to-date and to exchange with other researchers. B2DROP is an ideal solution to store and exchange data with colleagues and team members, synchronise multiple versions of data and ensure automatic desktop synchronisation of large files.$B2FIND is the EUDAT metadata service and provides a discovery portal which allows users to find data collections within an international and inter-disciplinary scope. It is based on a comprehensive metadata catalogue of research data collections stored in EUDAT data centres and other repositories. Harmonization of the metadata descriptions collected from heterogeneous sources enables not only the presentation in a consistent form but as well the faceted search across scientific domain boundaries.$B2STAGE is a reliable, efficient, light-weight and easy-to-use service to transfer research data sets between EUDAT storage resources and high-performance computing (HPC) workspaces.$B2HANDLE is the distributed service for storing, managing and accessing persistent identifiers (PIDs) and essential metadata (PID records) as well as managing PID namespaces. The implementation of the service relies on the DONA/Handle persistent identifier solution.$B2ACCESS is the EUDAT federated cross-infrastructure authorisation and authentication framework for user identification and community-defined access control enforcement. B2ACCESS allows EUDAT users to authenticate themselves using a variety of credentials.

For the communities who need to guard against data loss, B2SAFE is a customer facing service that allow data replication and safe storage between geographically distributed centres in the EUDAT CDI.$For the individuals researchers who do not have adequate facilities for storing, preserving and sharing data, B2SHARE Service is a customer-facing service which provides a safe repository for scientific data and a easy way to share it in the research community.$For the individuals researchers who need to synchronise and exchange data with one or multiple users, B2DROP Service is a customer-facing solution to store and exchange data with colleagues and team members.$For Communities and other providers of research data who need to publish and give visibility to their metadata and individual researchers who need to search data from everywhere, and see data in the context with an across community approach.$For Communities who need to transfer large data collection from EUDAT CDI to HPC. B2STAGE Service is a customer-facing service that allow high performance transfers in a reliable, fast, easy to use environment.$B2HANDLE can be used by middleware applications, end-user tools and other service to reliably identify data objects over longer timespans and through changes in object location or ownership. The B2HANDLE service encompasses management of identifier namespaces (Handle prefixes), establishment of policies and business workflows, operation of Handle servers and technical services, and a user-friendly Python library for general interaction with Handle servers and EUDAT-specific extensions. B2HANDLE is mostly transparent to end-users, shielding them from the complexity of infrastructure details. In the background, B2HANDLE operates as a federation and based on policies that aim to ensure high availability of Handle resolution by cross-site mirroring of Handles. B2HANDLE supports a dedicated Handle record structure (a PID profile) for the safe data management within an infrastructure with a given topology. By relying on features of the PID profile, end-users can, for instance, ensure authenticity of objects with checksums and timestamps and account for replicated objects across multiple locations.$For EUDAT service users and EUDAT service providers who need a single login for EUDAT. B2ACCESS service is a customer facing services provides a federates access to the B2 services in a trusted way.
