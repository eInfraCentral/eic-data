    <description>Service Monitoring keeps an eye on the performance of your IT services and quickly detects and resolves
        any issues. The service monitors the infrastructure by collecting the monitoring data generated by functional
        probes. The raw data is merged into statistics and available through the user interface in a user-friendly way.
        This service builds on EGI’s ten years’ experience of monitoring distributed e-infrastructures. With Service
        Monitoring you will get: - Minimal development effort for setting up monitoring services - Ready-to-use user
        interface - Automated reporting tools
